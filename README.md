# Animats 263C
Project: Learning in Animats to Cache Food for Later
Fall 16

Hypotheses: 

Consider an environment with a species of rodents(e.g. squirrels) and sources of food. The availability of the food changes with time(seasons). The animat will learn to store the food in caches. Competitor animat will attempt theft on cache. Animat will eventually learn to protect cache from potential competitor animats.

Description: This video is a short demo on the project. It shows 4 animats in the environment. The animats are seen to be eating from the food source, storing food into caches and also eating from the caches when they get hungry. The video displays the change of seasons by the varying amount of food sources available.

Description: This video shows the behavior of the animats in the presence of competitor animats. The competitors are shown in red color. They are seen to be eating the majority of the food sources. Hence, the food gets depleted. The animats try to eat and store the remaining food. However, the animats die more frequently which opens up a new challenge for us: making the animats learn to have some cache protection strategies.
