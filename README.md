# Animats 263C
Project: Learning in Animats to Cache Food for Later
Fall 16

Hypotheses: 
Consider an environment with a species of rodents(e.g. squirrels) and sources of food. The availability of the food changes with time(seasons). The animat will learn to store the food in caches. Competitor animat will attempt theft on cache. Animat will eventually learn to protect cache from potential competitor animats.
